Continue building the Real-Time Audio Transcription App with the following improvements and corrections:

---

1Ô∏è‚É£ Real-Time Audio Streaming Logic:
    - Modify `Recorder.js` to:
        - Capture audio in **5-second chunks** with a **500ms overlap**.
        - Stream each chunk immediately to `Transcriber.js` for processing, instead of waiting for the full recording to stop.
        - Use the `ondataavailable` event to handle chunking logic.
    - Example of the logic:
        - When `ondataavailable` is triggered, send the current chunk:
            - Convert it to a `Blob`.
            - Pass it to `Transcriber.js`.
            - Update the UI in real-time.

---

2Ô∏è‚É£ Real-Time Transcription Logic:
    - Update `Transcriber.js` to:
        - Accept small **5-second chunks** and stream them asynchronously to OpenAI Whisper.
        - Implement a **real-time text update** to `App.js`.
        - If Whisper API fails:
            - Retry up to **3 times**.
            - If it still fails, show an error message in the UI.

---

3Ô∏è‚É£ UI Enhancements:
    - In `App.js`:
        - Auto-scroll the `<textarea>` to display the latest transcription line.
        - Add status indicators:
            - "üî¥ Recording‚Ä¶" when capturing audio.
            - "üîÑ Transcribing‚Ä¶" when sending to OpenAI.
            - "‚úÖ Complete" when transcription is done.
        - Implement a **loading spinner** during API calls.
    - In `UIControls.js`:
        - Start/Stop buttons should:
            - Immediately start chunk-based recording on "Start".
            - Immediately stop and send the last chunk on "Stop".

---

4Ô∏è‚É£ Real-Time Duplicate Removal Logic:
    - In `TextCleaner.js`:
        - Implement a **line-by-line comparison** with a tolerance for partial words.
        - Automatically detect overlapping duplicates as new chunks arrive.
        - Remove these duplicates before displaying them in the UI.
        - This should be fully automated, no manual edits needed.

---

5Ô∏è‚É£ Error Handling:
    - In `Transcriber.js`:
        - Implement a retry mechanism for API calls:
            - Retry up to **3 times** with a 1-second delay between attempts.
            - If it fails after 3 tries, display a clear error message in the UI.
    - In `Recorder.js`:
        - Handle microphone disconnects gracefully.
        - Display a popup or alert if the microphone is disconnected.

---

6Ô∏è‚É£ Deployment and Testing:
    - Test thoroughly to ensure:
        - Real-time text updates are visible in the UI.
        - Segments are streamed to OpenAI Whisper without delay.
        - Duplicate lines are cleaned up before display.
        - Microphone access is reliable and reconnects if interrupted.
    - Prepare the app for deployment on Replit with proper microphone access.

---

Your job is to:
    - Correctly implement this logic in the existing components.
    - Ensure that each chunk of audio is processed in real-time.
    - Verify that the UI is fully interactive and responsive.
    - Test for synchronization, duplicate removal, and error handling.
